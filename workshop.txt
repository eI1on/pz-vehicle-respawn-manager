title=[B41] Vehicle Respawn Manager
description=Take control of where, what, and how vehicles respawn after [b]salvaging[/b] them. Define your own spawn zones, balance vehicle types with category rates, protect safehouses, and keep performance smooth on live servers.

description=[h1]What it does[/h1]
description=[list]
description=[*][b]Zones[/b]: Create your own vehicle respawn zones. Mark them as [b]Global[/b] (use the entire map's world vehicle zones) or [b]Non-Global[/b] (restricted to world vehicle zones inside set coordinates).
description=[*][b]Blacklist Zones[/b]: Mark areas where [b]no vehicles ever spawn[/b] (great for big bases or event locations). [b]Global[/b] blacklist disables spawning entirely.
description=[*][b]Safehouse-aware[/b]: World vehicle zones that intersect a player safehouse (with a configurable buffer) are automatically excluded to avoid driveway/base spawns.
description=[*][b]Categories & Rates[/b]: Group vehicles into categories (e.g., Common, Rare, Military) and assign a [b]spawn rate per category[/b]. When a category is picked, a vehicle from that category is chosen at random.
description=[*][b]Default Category[/b]: Optionally auto-assign all unassigned vehicle scripts to a chosen default category; maintain a per-zone blacklist to exclude the ones you never want.
description=[*][b]Per-zone cap[/b]: Set a [b]maximum vehicles per zone[/b] to prevent overcrowding.
description=[*][b]Manual spawns[/b]: From the UI, queue spawns [b]Random[/b] or [b]Fixed (by script)[/b], with a count.
description=[*][b]Import/Export[/b]: Save and load your full zone setup to JSON for backups or sharing.
description=[*][b]Performance-friendly[/b]: Server-side queue with retries, timed spawns per tick, chunk-aware delayed spawns, and configurable intervals.
description=[*][b]Logging[/b]: Toggle debug logs to see zone picks, attempts, failures/successes.

description=[h1]How spawning works (short version)[/h1]
description=[list]
description=[*][b]Priority[/b]: If a [b]global blacklist[/b] exists > no spawns. Else pick the first [b]Global Zone[/b] (if any), otherwise a [b]Non-Global Zone[/b].
description=[*][b]Location[/b]: For Global Zones, pick a random world vehicle zone anywhere on the map. For Non-Global, pick a [b]world defined vehicle zones[/b] which intersects with the picked zone and tries to spawn a vehicle in it.
description=[*][b]Validation[/b]: Rejects world defined vehicle zones inside blacklist zones, near safehouses (based on a sandbox configurable buffer), water, or tiles too close to other vehicles. Respects the zone's max-vehicle limit.
description=[*][b]Retries & queue[/b]: Limited attempts per request. If the chunk isn't ready or the point is blocked, the request is re-queued or delayed until the square loads.

description=[*]Optionally enable [b]Default Category for Unassigned[/b] and pick which category it is.
description=[*]Set [b]Maximum Vehicles per Zone[/b]. Use [b]Manual Vehicle Spawn[/b] to queue Random/Fixed spawns.

description=[h1] Frequently Asked Question: [/h1]
description=
description=[h2] Is it compatible with Multiplayer? [/h2]
description= Absolutely! Extensively tested and fully functional on MP servers.
description=
description=[h2] Does it work on existing saves? [/h2]
description= Absolutely! Enable it mid-save without issues.
description=
description=[h2]Why don't vehicles spawn at my base?[/h2]
description=World vehicle zones that intersect a safehouse plus its buffer are excluded. Adjust the [b]Safehouse Buffer Zone[/b] sandbox option if needed.
description=
description=[h2]A spawn failed in the logs - is that normal?[/h2]
description=Yes. The system queues, delays, and retries spawns if chunks aren't loaded or tiles are blocked, up to the configured attempt limits.
description=
description=[h2] Does it work for all game versions? [/h2]
description= Only tested and working on the latest game version (v41.78.16).
