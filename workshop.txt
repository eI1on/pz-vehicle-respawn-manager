description=[h1]Vehicle Respawn Manager[/h1]
description=
description=Take control of vehicle spawns in [b]Project Zomboid[/b] with the [b]Vehicle Respawn Manager[/b]. This mod allows you to meticulously manage where and how vehicles respawn in your game world.

description=[h1]How It Works[/h1]
description=
description=The [b]Vehicle Respawn Manager[/b] operates by defining specific [b]spawn zones[/b] where vehicles can appear. These zones can be [b]global[/b] (affecting the entire map) or [b]non-global[/b] (restricted to certain areas). Additionally, the mod incorporates [b]blacklist zones[/b] to prevent vehicles from spawning in undesired locations.
